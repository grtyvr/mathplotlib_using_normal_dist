# mathplotlib_using_normal_dist
Learning Mathplotlib by plotting the normal distribution.

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook and resulting Matplotlib plots that were used for the blog post https://grtyvr.com/blog/2021/11/23/matplotlib-howto/.

The notebook is an itterative approach to creating a plot of the normal distribution with markers for the 2.5% and 97.5% points on the normal distribution with a shaded area that illustrates what the value that a Cumulative Distribution function takes on at a point means in terms of area under the normal curve.
